# Problem Analysis & Research

## Problem Definition
Describe the core problem you are solving. Example:
> People want to find neighborhoods that match their lifestyle, but current tools are too generic or don't use real data.

## User Research
- How did you identify user needs?
- What did you learn from talking to potential users or reviewing forums/reviews?

## Existing Solutions & Gaps
- List a few existing tools (e.g., Niche, Zillow, WalkScore)
- What do they do well? What's missing?

## Hypotheses
- Example: Users who value parks will prefer neighborhoods with high walk scores and green spaces.

## Data Sources
- Where did you get your data? (e.g., open data portals, CSVs, mySql)

## Validation
- How did you use data to test your hypotheses?
