# Analysis & Reflection

## Testing & Validation
- Tried various combinations of preferences.
- Results matched expectations (e.g., "Modern, Young Professionals" returns "Sector 143").

## Data Challenges
- Needed to ensure data in MySQL matched the expected format.
- Handled empty results gracefully in the UI.

## Effectiveness
- The app is functional and user-friendly.
- Limitations: Only keyword matching, no advanced filtering.

## Future Improvements
- Add user accounts and favorites.
- Use real open data from city APIs.
- Add more filters (e.g., rent range, school ratings).
- Deploy the app online for public use.
